# effectiveMordenCpp-s-notes

These are the notes I took when I first studied effectiveMordenCpp.This is the material I referred to during my study. I highly recommend watching the video and then reading the book to help deepen your understanding.

Since I first watched the video and then read the original book during the learning process, most of the notes can be found in the original text in the video and the original book.When the author develops actual projects and encounters relevant topics in the notes, I will supplement the study again.
